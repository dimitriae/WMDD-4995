# How to make a vector out of your brush lettering.
## Using Photoshop and Illustrator
Brush lettering is something I’m particularly fond of. They look beautiful and personal in designs, but for some it’s always a pain to digitalize and use a brush lettering. In this tutorial you will learn how to transform your brush lettering from a picture, to a vector.

### Step 1:
Take a picture of your lettering. A good picture always count, so look for a bright place and take a good shot of your art. If you have a scanner at home, feel free to scan the lettering. A scanned document will have more detail than the picture taken.
Here is my picture:

### Step 2:
Now open your picture on Photoshop and go to image>adjustments>brightness/contrast

In this step we are going to try to get rid of some shadows, just use brightness to enlighten the picture and contrast so you don’t loose a lot of detail.

### Step 5
Go to Image>adjustments>Levels
In this step we are going to get rid of shadows and make the lettering outlines more strong. Just drag the little arrows on the corners to the center, keep an eye on your art so you don’t make it too light ot too dark.

Now got to Curves using the same path (Image>Adjustments>Curves)

Drag the line up a bit and down a bit so it looks a little like the example. Here we are still making the outline of the lettering stronger.

### Step 6
Go to the layers window and double click on your image layer. Let’s get rid of the white background by dragging the arrows at the end of the window left.

Open your Illustrator and drag the png into a document.
